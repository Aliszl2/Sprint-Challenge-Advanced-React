- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps

For software quality.
To reduce risk when refactoring,
It encourages better (more testable) code,
Identifies bugs faster.
Reduces the risk of regressions.
Allows us to trust the code.
Makes us think about the edge cases.
Acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring.
